Great question — I've done a **code-level review** of your files (`train.py`, `trainer.py`, `transformer.py`, `common_layers.py`), specifically looking for **bugs or architectural flaws** that could cause your model to behave like this (e.g., `CER > 100%`, WER = `100%`, gibberish predictions). Here's a breakdown:

---

###### -> add eos ->smoothing for ce = 0.1





## ✅ Overall Architecture — Seems Structurally OK

You're using a Transformer encoder-decoder with optional VGG-style or simple CNN feature extractor → encoder → decoder. All the standard blocks are present:

- LayerNorm, positional embeddings ✔️  
- Multi-head self-attention and cross-attention ✔️  
- Feedforward with GELU ✔️  
- Dropout and label smoothing support ✔️

BUT: It’s **not the architecture that’s broken** — it’s the **training dynamics, decoding, and possibly token mismatch.**

---

## ❗ Real Issues and Suspects in the Code

### 1. 🔥 Decoder **loops garbage** — likely bad `tgt_input` during training
In `trainer.py`:
```python
tgt_input = tgt[:, :-1]
logits = self.model(src, src_mask, tgt_input, tgt_mask)
```
This is fine.

BUT: Your targets are not padded consistently! You’re not trimming/padding with care — meaning decoder sees **misaligned garbage**.

Also:
```python
loss = self.loss_fn(logits.reshape(-1, logits.size(-1)), tgt[:, 1:].reshape(-1))
```
If `tgt[:, 1:]` includes padding tokens **not set to `ignore_index`**, your model is **learning to predict padding**. That kills it.

✅ Fix idea:
Ensure `ignore_index = PAD_ID` and all `tgt` sequences are right-padded to the **same length**.
Even better: add `attention_mask` to the decoder.

---

### 2. ❗**No EOS token in your vocab** — CE decoding never stops

Your vocab:
```python
{'¶': 0, '§': 1, '¤': 2, '_': 3, "'": 4, 'a': 5, ..., ' ': 31}
```
You're missing **`<eos>`** or **`<end>`** token, so the model has no idea when to stop decoding during inference. That explains:

- Repetition ("andthemorethatthemore...")
- Overlong sequences
- High CER

✅ Fix idea:
- Add `<eos>` token to your vocab and use it during training.
- During inference, **stop decoding when `<eos>` is generated**.

---

### 3. ❗ Possibly Broken Blank Token in CTC

You're using `_` (id = 3) as blank for CTC?

Check in `trainer.py`:
```python
self.loss_fn = nn.CTCLoss(blank=self.args.blank_id, ...)
```
Make sure `args.blank_id = 3`. Otherwise, **CTC is trashing real characters** thinking they’re blanks.

✅ Fix idea:
Add this in `train.py` or `trainer.py`:
```python
parser.add_argument("--blank_id", type=int, default=3)
```

---

### 4. ⚠️ No Teacher Forcing Rate or Scheduled Sampling

Decoder is **greedy decoding only** and trained with full ground truth input. But inference runs autoregressive.

Mismatch = catastrophic for unstable decoders.

✅ Fix idea:
- Implement scheduled sampling (teacher forcing ratio decreasing with epochs).
- Even 5% noise can help it stabilize.

---

### 5. ⚠️ Rescoring or Beam Search May Be Misused

You’re passing:
```python
lm_scores = calculate_lm_score(hyp_seqs)
```

If your `calculate_lm_score()` is returning **high scores to garbage sequences**, it may actually **encourage repetition**.

✅ Fix idea:
- Temporarily disable LM rescoring.
- Compare pure greedy decoding vs beam with/without LM.

---

### 6. ⚠️ Feature extractor is optional but critical

You're using:
```python
self.frontend = nn.Conv2d(...)  # or vgg-style
```

Make sure:
- Audio is normalized properly
- Feature shapes are consistent (e.g., [B, T, D])
- Audio-to-feature scaling matches training labels

---

### ✅ Summary: What Needs Fixing First

| Priority | Problem | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| 🚨 High | No `<eos>` token | Add EOS to vocab + decoder stops when it's generated |
| 🚨 High | Padding tokens are trained on | Add `ignore_index=PAD_ID` to CE loss, pad properly |
| 🚨 High | Check if blank token is really `id=3` | Confirm `--blank_id=3` is passed to CTC |
| ⚠️ Medium | Decoder uses greedy inference but is trained with full ground truth | Add scheduled sampling |
| ⚠️ Medium | Beam search + LM rescoring might help/hurt | Compare with/without LM |
| ⚠️ Low | Visualize encoder output + attention | Check what decoder is attending to |
| ✅ Bonus | Train on 1 sample to sanity check | Model must overfit 1 sample to prove it can learn |
